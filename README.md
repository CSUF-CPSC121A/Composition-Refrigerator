# Instructions  

Create a `Refrigerator` using its default constructor. Display information about the `Refrigerator`. 

Conduct three checkups on 10/10/2022, 09/01/2022, and 10/01/2022. Display "Checkup completed" whenever a checkup was done and "Checkup cannot be done in the past" otherwise.

Create a `std::map` with a `std::string` key and `int` value to represent the `Refrigerator`'s contents. Initialize the map with these values: 3 Milk, 2 Apple, and 10 Water. Instantiate a `Refrigerator` object passing in a `Date` object representing 10/11/2022, 20 for its maximum contents and the `std::map` we created. Display the refrigerator's last checkup date and all of its contents.
